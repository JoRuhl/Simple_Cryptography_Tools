# Simple_Cryptography_Tools
This is a collection of simple scripts used to crack cryptography puzzles I've come across. Most also include the reciprocal function to encode text using the same method.
The majority of these come from, or were inspired by Boxentriq, though every effort has been made to scrub specific solutions or hints.
For more info on usage, see comments on each script.
